                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
                    For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or
                    using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
                    understanding of HTML and its functions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                    elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
                    certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
                    somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example,
                    take the following line of content:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    paragraph tags:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>&ltp&gtMy cat is very grumpy&lt/p&gt</code>

                <p>
                    HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core
                    technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and
                    aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the
                    basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. Learn more below about:
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>
                    <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
                    <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for
                        information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>
                    <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their
                        documents.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label
                    pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.
                </p>

                <p>What is CSS?
                    CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and
                    fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
                    small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup
                    language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets
                    across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of
                    structure (or: content) from presentation.

            <article>
                <p>
                    <code>&ltp&gtMy cat is very grumpy&lt/p&gt</code>
                </p>
                Considering these codes, let's explore this paragraph element a bit further. The main parts of our
                element are as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Opening Tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
                        wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to
                        take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                    <code>&lt</code>
                    <li><strong>The Closing Tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                        forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where
                        the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can
                        lead to strange results.</li>
                    <code>&gt</code>
                    <li><strong>The Content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just
                        text.</li>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <li><strong>The Element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together
                        comprise
                        the element.</li>
                    <code>p</code>
                </ol>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Doctype_Metadata">
            <header>Doctype and metadata</header>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctype</strong>: You should use the HTML5 doctype. It is short, easy to remember, and backwards
                compatible:
                <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Document language</strong>: Set the document language using the lang attribute on your <html>
                element:
                <code>&lthtml lang="en-US"&gt</code>
                This is good for accessibility and search engines, helps with localizing content, and reminds people to
                use best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Document characterset</strong>: You should also define your document's characterset like so:
                <code>&ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt</code>
                Use UTF-8 unless you have a very good reason not to; it will cover your character needs pretty much
                regardless of what language you are using in your document
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Viewport meta tag</strong>: Finally, you should always add the viewport meta tag into your HTML

                <head>, to give the example a better chance of working on mobile devices. You should include at least
                    the following in your document, which can be modified later on as the need arises:
                    <code>&ltmeta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt</code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <article>
                To get started with writing HTML, open any code editor and write your
                first "Hello World" HTML code:
                <code>&ltp&gtHello World&lt/p&gt
        </code>

                Select the code in the code editor and hit refresh to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting">
            <header>Nesting elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that
                    our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &ltstrong> element, which means that the
                    word is to be strongly emphasized:
                </p>
                <code>&ltp>My cat is &ltstrong>very&lt/strong> grumpy.&lt/p></code>
                <p>
                    You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we
                    opened the &ltp> element first, then the &ltstrong> element; therefore, we have to close the
                    &ltstrong> element first, then the &ltp> element. The following is incorrect:
                </p>
                <code>&ltp>My cat is &ltstrong>very grumpy.&lt/p>&lt/strong></code>
                <p>
                    The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one
                    another.
                    If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you
                    were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results.
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
            <header>Empty Elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the &ltimg> element that we
                    already have in our HTML page:
                </p>
                <code>&ltimg src="img/cat.jpg" alt="My test image"></code>

                <p>
                    This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is
                    because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the
                    HTML page in the place it appears.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Images">
            <header>Images</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Let's turn our attention to the <img> element again:
                </p>
                <code>&ltimg src="img/cat.jpg" alt="My test image"></code>
                <p>
                    As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the
                    src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive
                    text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called
                        screen readers to read out the alt text to them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately
                        changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the
                        page, you should see something like this in place of the image:
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <code>My test image</code>
                <p>
                    The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader
                    with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current
                    text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be
                    "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."

                    Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or
                    subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML
                    document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels,
                    &lth1>–&lth6>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
                </p>
                <code>&lth1>My main title&lt/h1>
                    &lth2>My top level heading&lt/h2>
                    &lth3>My subheading&lt/h3>

                    As explained above, &ltp> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these
                    frequently when marking up regular text content:

                    A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always
                    consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

                        list. These are wrapped in a &ltul> element.</li>
                    <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These
                        are wrapped in an &ltol> element.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Each item inside the lists is put inside an &ltli> (list item) element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list
                </p>
                <code>&ltp>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... &lt/p></code>
                <p>
                    We could modify the markup to this
                </p>
                <code>&ltp>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt/p>

                    &ltul>
                        &nbsp&ltli>technologists&lt/li>
                        &nbsp&ltli>thinkers&lt/li>
                        &nbsp&ltli>builders&lt/li>
                    &lt/ul>

                <p>
                    Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple
                    element — &lta> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a
                    link, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrap the text in an &lta> element, as shown below:
                    </li>
                    <code>&lta>Mozilla Manifesto&lt/a></code>
                    <li>
                        Give the &lta> element an href attribute, as shown below:
                    </li>
                    <code>&lta href="">Mozilla Manifesto&lt/a></code>
                    <li>
                        Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
                    </li>
                    <code>&lta href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto&lt/a></code>
                </ol>
                <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at
                    the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where
                    you wanted it to.
